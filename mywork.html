                                <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;">There is not a long history of computers in Nepal. Nepal hired some types of calculators and computers for it’s census calculation. The first step towards the use of electronic gadgets in Nepal was seen in 1961 along with the arrival of <strong>Facet.</strong> It was merely a calculator, but not a computer. It was used for the census of 1961. The first embark of digitalization actually started with the use of IBM 1401, a second-generation mainframe computer that was used in the 1971 census.</div>

                                <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;"> Cyber security is the technique of securing computers, electronic systems, networks, and data from online malicious attacks. It focuses on keeping cybercriminals and malicious hackers from gaining access, disrupting, or changing the systems and applications without the owner's consent. <strong>Cyber security in Nepal</strong> started its peak in 2017 when <a href="https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/mycity/news/nepal-vulnerable-to-cyber-attacks" target="_blank">58 different governmental sites were hacked</a> by a group of hackers named “Paradox Cyber Ghost”. They leaked the customers' information and citizens' information creating a threat to the general public as well as governmental organizations.</div>
                                <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;">Because an organization’s assets are composed of a variety of different platforms, a strong cyber security posture requires coordinated efforts across all of its systems.</div>
                    </div><br>
                    <h4 class="col-lg-12 fw-bolder mb-2">What is the importance of Cyber security in Nepal?</h4>
                    <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;">In developing countries like Nepal, the main topic of discussion reflects this trend with significant nuances. Nepal's data privacy is still developing compared to international norms. Despite not having a comprehensive data protection regulation like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), Nepal's constitution recognizes the right to privacy as being essential. Data protection rules are in there, but there are no enforcement methods. However, problems still exist. Data leaks of leading companies of Nepal, including eSewa, Foodmandu, Vianet, NIC Asia have heightened concerns about data security and privacy in the digital era. While digital payment systems like eSewa provide convenience, they also pose risks, such as data breaches that can compromise sensitive user information and transaction history.</div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;">Cyber security in Nepal is important to protect personal, government data, information and server from theft, damage, and malware. Without cybersecurity, neither an organization nor an individual will be able to defend their data from cyber-attacks. The level of cybercrimes is increasing day by day and becoming more vulnerable. Many innocent users get affected by cybercrimes through different cyber-attacks that are attempted by hackers. It has become as risky in the present world as the world is digitizing and technologies are developing and more hackers are evolving and inventing new ideas to attempt cybercrime.</div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;">Due to the increasing number of cybercrimes, cyber security in Nepal is very important and a greater necessity to keep personal and confidential data, information safe. Different organizations are implementing cyber security to protect confidential data and information and to protect servers and networks. One of the great information security scandals to be remembered was the 2019 Facebook record breaking 5 billion dollar fine which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/22/facebook-vs-feds-inside-story-multi-billion-dollar-tech-giants-privacy-war-with-washington/" target="_blank">Facebook agreed to pay</a> to the US Federal Trade Commission. At the highest levels of government and business, the need to protect confidential information is a top priority.</div>

                    <h4 class="col-lg-12 fw-bolder mb-2">What are the cyber security issues in Nepal?</h4>
                    <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;">Some of the major cybersecurity issues reported in Nepal include ransom, phishing, and data breach, banking frauds, defamation, slander, online identity theft and individual cybercrimes.</div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12" style="font-size: 17px;">In June 2017, a group of <a href="https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/mycity/news/nepal-vulnerable-to-cyber-attacks" target="_blank">Turkish hackers hacked the Department of Passport</a> Official website leaving a threat to reveal government's data. In October, the <a href="https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2017/11/642528" target="_blank">Swift system of NIC Asia bank</a> was hacked by an unidentified hacker. Similarly in April 2020, data of more than 160,000 customers of Vianet Communication were leaked through twitter handles. Due to this act, various companies have started to provide dynamic cyber security services to help businesses and organizations cope with data breaches.</div>

                    <div class="col-lg-6">In 2020, an alarming data breach shook Vianet's customers: Nepal's significant internet service provider (ISP). A vulnerability in the company's system enabled unauthorized access to the confidential information of more than 170,000 people, such as names, emails, phone numbers, and other data. This violation revealed the sensitive information of Vianet subscribers, consequently putting them in peril of different fraudulent activities, including phishing and identity theft.</div>

                    <div class="col-lg-6">In 2017, one of the private-sector commercial banks in Nepal, NIC Asia Bank, was the victim of a hack attack that resulted in hackers sending fraudulent money transactions through the SWIFT interbank messaging system. Hackers violated the bank's security, gaining unlawful access to confidential customer data.<br>
                    Nepal's first and largest digital wallet, eSewa, experienced a data breach in October 2020. During the event, a cybercriminal divulged the confidential information of at least 21 persons, which included theirelectronic mail addresses, concealed passwords, and account funds. The violation could have occurred dueto the lack of OTP (One-Time Password) authentication during the Internet sign-in procedure.</div>

                    <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>In developing countries like Nepal, three areas have been identified related to cyber security threats: (a) poor digital access, (b) institutional instability, and (c) regime instability. However, cyber security policies in Nepal still cannot address the cyber security threats and issues in the country. It was found through my research Iconducted in Nepal that majority of the people mainly believed that there are ineffective cyber security policies as no proper cyber law in Nepal has been implemented. Based on the survey, 67% provided this perception. There is no proper cyber law in Nepal. If an  individual commits a cyber-crime, there is very little chance that the Nepal government can do in terms of enforcing the legal policies.</div>
                  </div><br>
                  <div class="row">
                    <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>The country's cyber law progress has moved very slowly because email and computer transactions are not considered trustworthy by the government. The country does not utilize the same level of technology as other developed countries. The Nepalgovernment believes that passwords can be easily guessed, thus leading to the hackingof user’s accounts, which is largely due to outdated IT systems being used by high- profile government agencies. Part of the problem is that Nepal citizens tend to make easily-guessed passwords using numbers and information significant in their lives,including their first and last names, birthdays, phone numbers, and locations. The Nepalpolice department is working with the outdated Cyber Law Act of 2006/2007. Since the legislation (Electronic Media Act) was passed in 2006/2007, there has been little to no cyber law reform, which is crucial for staying up-to-date on information regarding changing technology. Laws on cyber-matter should be updated frequently and regularly.</div>

                  <div class="row">
                    <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>Nepal faces a general lack of policy, up-to-date software, and IT knowledge which has led to frequent spamming, fishing, and password piracy issues. These problems indicate a very ineffective cyber policy based on the perceptions of IT professionals. Another observation was that there are effective cyber security policies as institutions have been established to prevent crimes; 17% professionals believed that there are effective cyber security policies in Nepal. According to the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Department, the government punishes individuals who commit cybercrimes, with consequences based on the level of the crime committed. The Cyber Law Act of 2006/2007 declared hacking, stealing data, pirating software, and posting defamatory information online as being criminal and civil offences. Under this law, the government can punish cyber-offenders with up to five years of imprisonment and/or a fine of up to$1,000 depending on the severity. According to CIB, the agency keeps systematic records of the reported crimes.</div><br>

                  <div class="row">
                    <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>The police department has also claimed that awarenessprograms are being conducted in many locations on a regular basis. Conversely, the banking sector claims to have appropriate security measures in place. This sectorclaims to utilize primarily genuine software, VPN access for branches, firewalls,awareness programs for employees, password updating policies, proper backup systems, and high availability with SAN and VMware technologies. They also claim that all systems are being updated regularly; however, there are some locations in Nepal where the ATMs are still using Windows XP as an operating system. Microsoft stopped supporting Windows XP in April of 2014 after it was identified that the operating systemhad the highest number of vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, based on the survey, 11% IT professionals also believed that there were ineffective cyber security policies for the institutions as they feel unavoidable of receiving cyber threats and viruses. IT professionals perceived that the computer devices used on many college campuses could easily transfer viruses, as most hadpirated antivirus software installed on those devices. Pen-drive is largely to blame for the transferring of viruses because the software does not detect malware. It is not fully scanned by the anti-virus software. Many citizens of Nepal are not aware of how to conduct a virus scan on their devices. 6% of IT professionals believed that the country is  lagging behind other countries in technology sector due to ineffective polices.</div>

                    <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>It was found through the observation that the decision of minimizing the risks of cyber security would incur extra costs, primarily the reason why the users have not made concrete efforts to ensure their cyber safety. 44% of the study shared this major perception. Professionals stated that using genuine versions of operating systems would create additional costs because they are generally more expensive. For example,computer parts cost about $150, antivirus software is about $30, a genuine  operating system is about $150, and if the user wishes to add SQL Apache this would cost  an additional $200. The total can be anywhere between $350 and $400 compared to  $200 for pirated software. It is common practice for the sellers of the devices to provide customers with both a pirated and genuine software option. Companies and institutions are unwilling to fully invest in cyber security unless they are able to realize immediate benefits.</div>

                    <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>Another perception why cyber security policies are not maximized for the safety of the users was the lack of awareness with regard to security on the users’ end. The security has not improved because the preventive actions the government has taken still largely depend on the clients or users. IT professionals also commented that there was a perceived lack of awareness on the part of parents. Many parents are unaware of theirchildren’s online activities, which often include misusing social networks such as Facebook, twitter etc. and sharing passwords, activities, and statuses without understanding the consequences. The lack of awareness of the users is one of the main reasons why minimizing security risks have been difficult for the government to pursue.</div>
                  </div><br>
                  <div class="row">
                    <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>Most cybercrime cases are never reported. In the majority of cases, victims themselves are unaware that they have become victims. There was also the issue of the unwillingness of the old generation to see changes, this the interference of ensuring minimal risks of cyber security breach in Nepal is notachieved. Professionals also shared that because of the generation gap or the fear of change, cyber security policies have not been implemented properly. Many government agencies and companies are afraid to upgrade software due to not understanding how it works. Participants also cited language barriers and lack of education as other potential issues. Members of an older generation tend to hold power in government agencies which can sometimes lead to lack of willingness to change. <br>
                      The competition between IT professionals became a barrier in achieving a full protection from cyber risks. Another factor was competition between professionals, highlighting a lack of support to reduce and solve cyber security issues because of personal and business interests. There is a sense that if companies make individuals more aware of ways to maximize cyber security they may lose their businesses.
                      It was determined that the self-awareness and literacy of the users are the main protections and answers deemed by the IT professionals to develop more efficient actions in minimizing risks of cyber security breach in Nepal. 67% of IT professionals stated this perception. Self-awareness and the literacy of users are crucial to solving and achieving the goal of minimizing the risks of cyber security breaches in Nepal.</div>

Educating and training people on cyber security is an effective way to promote awareness and get individuals and entities to take proactive steps. It's crucial to implement multi-factor authentication, consistent software updates, and strong data encryption to enhance digital system security. Evaluating and monitoring third-party service provider security measures is significant. Nepal should update its cybersecurity regulations to align with current risks and best practices. Developing and testing incident response procedures is vital. Improving collaboration and information sharing can enhance Nepal's overall cybersecurity. The country has taken steps towards addressing cybersecurity issues through initiatives like the National Cybersecurity Framework. Data security includes strategies, tools, and controls to protect digital information. Its primary goal is to safeguard confidential data and make it available only to authorized personnel. Effective defensive systems are essential to safeguard against cyberattacks and suspicious access attempts, reducing risks by preventing sensitive information disclosure and ensuring compliance with data protection laws.</div> </div><br> <div class="row"> <div><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 20px; padding-right:5px"></i>It is imperative for organizations to take robust technical security measures to protect themselves from data breaches.

By utilizing these safeguards, businesses can drastically reduce their susceptibilities to cyber-attacks and assure the confidentiality and accuracy of confidential data. Data minimization techniques and frequent security audits can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Nepal must establish strong privacy policies that align with international data privacy trends and adhere to strict data protection laws to increase public trust and promote responsible data usage.</div></div> <br><div class="row">

Providing proper training and sharing knowledge will also help to minimize the risks.Management should provide continuous support and awareness, and users shouldcarefully protect their accounts and passwords. Passwords should not be saved on anycomputer or be stored openly where they can be seen. Users should frequently change and update passwords with different letters and numbers. Security can be improved by avoiding unauthorized software. Additionally, the existing Cyber Act of 2006/2007 should be reconsidered for reform. Many individuals in Nepal are not aware of the country's cyber laws. The government should make such information available in order for citizens to be aware of the consequences. Professionals also suggested that cyberlaws should be strictly enforced. Large-scale companies such as Microsoft, Apple,RedHat and other major companies should also reconsider pricing, particularly making products more affordable. Poorer countries such as Nepal should not be charged the same prices as those of more developed nations.
